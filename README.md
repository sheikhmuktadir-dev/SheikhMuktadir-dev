## About Me

**UI + Frontend Developer (React Only)**  
*Self-taught in 2025* — mastered **React** from zero to production using **Udemy (Maximilian Schwarzmüller)** and **Youtube (freeCodeCamp & Code Stoic)**.

I build **clean, responsive, pixel-perfect UIs** that look great on every device. No fluff — just **React, Context API, async/await + fetch**, and **Tailwind CSS**.

---

**What I Do Best:**
- Turn Figma designs into fully functional React apps  
- Build smooth, fast, accessible user interfaces  
- Manage state cleanly with **React Context** (no external libraries)  
- Fetch and display real data with **async/await + error handling**  
- Deploy live in minutes using **Vercel/Netlify**

---

**Projects I’ve Built:**
- **Auria Property** – Modern real estate platform (listings, filters)  

*Can build & deploy any UI live in <24 hours — just send a design.*

**Dubai Onsite Only**  
Ready to relocate and work **in-person** with UAE teams.  
Fluent in English | Professional | Punctual | Team player

**I don’t need hand-holding. I need a challenge.**  
Give me a Figma file. I’ll return a live, production-ready React app.

**Dubai-based roles only. Let’s build something great — together.**
